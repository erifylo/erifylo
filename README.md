### Hi there, I'm Eri! ðŸ‘‹

<img src="https://github.com/erifylo/erifylo/blob/main/ErifyliEvangelouAvatar.png?raw=true">

I am a Front-end developer based in Barcelona, with a background in International Trade and Logistics.<br>
I have always been interested in the tech industry and this is one of the reasons I decided to enroll in Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. I recently graduated from it and I am ready to throw myself into a world of constant challenges, growth, and learning new things! <br>
I enjoy working in teams and in multicultural environments. I feel comfortable working in several languages and have more than 6 years of experience working and volunteering in international environments :) <br> 

 ðŸ’» Technologies: Javascript | ES6 | HTML5 | CSS3 | MongoDB | Bootstrap | React | Node.js | Express Axios | Gatsby | Strapi
