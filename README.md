I am a Front-end developer with a background in International Trade and Logistics. I am from Greece but I am living in Barcelona for the last two years. I enjoy working in teams and in multicultural environments. I feel comfortable working in several languages and have more than 6 years of experience working and volunteering in international environments :)
